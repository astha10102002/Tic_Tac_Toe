# Tic_Tac_Toe
The project is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using the Swing framework. The game is designed to be a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application where two players (Player X and Player O) take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The goal is to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
